# ATRT
Our goal is to introduce and standardize an advanced thermal response test, which is based acitively heated fiber optic method. 
The test named as actively heated fiber optic based thermal reponse test (ATRT), other named like ETRT and A-DTS could be also found in the literatures. 
The ATRT project is aimed to provide a standard data processing process to better shown the temperature results. 
Two ground property inversion cases also given to further explains the usability of ATRT, and reveals its application future in observing subsurface word.
