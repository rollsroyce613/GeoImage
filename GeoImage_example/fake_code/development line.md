The interface aims to give researchers a data processing tool (Matlab and Python). The project includes raw data input, data storage, temperature calibration, temperature intercept in time and depth, temperature thinning out, temperature encryption, temperature smooth, processed data storage, and processed data output. 

Our raw data is based on Silixa Ultima DTS (.xml files) and Nzsening DTS (.txt files). Such raw files created by Silixa and Nzsening both recorded the temperature along the length. Silixa files additionally given the stokes, anti-stokes scattered light intensity and Silixa built-in calibration method information.

No.1 raw data input and storage

Three main data types should be considering, input them and storage them to both Matlab and Python easy-read files (.mat or .py).
